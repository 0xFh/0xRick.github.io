#### Hey there ! If you came here then you're probably curious about the author of the write-ups you just read. A little about me, I'm a CyberSec enthusiast, CTF player and an aspiring penetration tester. I hack vulnerable machines most of the time so you're going to find a lot of write-ups about them here. What I share on this blog is a contribution to the community and something for myself to look at as a resource when I'm looking for a trick or a payload I forgot about. Any exploit I created in one of my write-ups will be on [this github repository](https://github.com/0xRick/CTF-scripts). Feedback and suggestions on blog development are always appreciated.
